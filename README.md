Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java
Database: MySQL
Database Connectivity: JDBC
GUI Framework: Swing/JavaFX
Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 8 or above installed.
MySQL Server: Installed and configured.
IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any other Java IDE.
JDBC Driver: MySQL Connector/J (add it to the project's classpath).

Database Setup


Start your MySQL server.
Create a database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE student_management;
Create a table to store student data:
sql

    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    age INT NOT NULL,
    course VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    grade VARCHAR(5) NOT NULL
);
Optionally, create a table for login credentials if needed:
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

Installation
